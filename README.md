if you want to run the application here is the steps

make sure you first install all the libraries for frontend and backend

BACKEND SETUP

1. add .env file in /rag-backend and put api keys like
      TAVILY_API_KEY= your api key
      GEMINI_API_KEY= your api key
2. to run the backend run this command "uvicorn main_api_app:app --reload"

FRONTEND SETUP

frontend is just a react app so you just need to write "npm start" make sure backend is running in background
